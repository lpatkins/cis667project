Installations:
Make sure you have NumPy downloaded on your computer. If you are running on Google Colab, the code already features the import statements for what is required for the game. 
Make sure you have TensorFlow downloaded on your computer. If you are running on Google Colab, the code already features the import statements for what is required for the game. 
Make sure you have MatPlotLib downloaded on your computer. If you are running on Google Colab, the code already features the import statements for what is required for the game. 
As for Python, I would say have anything 3.7 or later, pending on the platform you are using. If using Google Colab, they'll automatically have a compatible version of Python for your benefit.

Run interactive domain program:
1. Download the files to your screen, and keep them to the same folder. This will help in having the files being easily referable.
2. Run play_mancala.py. This will ask the user some prompts to intialize the game settings. Afterwards, the game will be up and running.

Run computer experiments:
1. Download the files to your screen, and keep them to the same folder. This will help in having the files being easily referable.
2. Run mancala_minimax.py. The main function has been adjusted so now a game between two AI systems are now competing as opposed to human vs AI.
